# Ruby API

This project is an API built with Rails in order to solidify my knowledge and understanding of creating a RESTful API from scratch. This API has full ability to make requests in order to perform CRUD on articles stored in a MySQL database. I have used Postgres and the Faker Gem to randomly generate the content.
